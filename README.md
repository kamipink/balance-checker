# balance-checker
The script uses fetch to make a request to the Etherscan API and then processes the response. 
 Please note that you must replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your own API key from Etherscan and provide the Ethereum address to check the balance. Additionally, you must have the web3 library available to convert balance from Wei to Ether.
